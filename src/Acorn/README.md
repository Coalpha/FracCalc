# Acorn

Acorn is a loose Java implimentation of the JavaScript parser Acorn.
Acorn contains three "subpackages"

- Acorn.Pestle
- Acorn.Stove
- Acorn.Squirrel

Acorn.Pestle is the tokenizer package
Acorn.Stove is the parser package
Acorn.Squirrel is what evaluates the resulting abstract syntax tree
