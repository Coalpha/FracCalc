# FracCalc

- Class: "Hey make a Fractional Calculator"
- Me: "Oh that'll be easy, I'll just use the JavaScript Engine (Nashorn)"
- Class: "...You didn't really learn anything."
- Me: "That's the point"
- Class: "Do it without using Nashorn"
- Me: "Okay, I guess I'll just make a JavaScript parser in Java then"
- Me: "This is really hard"
- Joshua: "You are like a little baby."
- Me: "Okay."
